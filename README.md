## Glue-Reversible

### Background

There are two main ways to consolidate selected items on a track natively in Reaper: **Glue** and **Groups**. Both have disadvantages. 

**Glue** is permanent: once you glue items together, you cannot make edits later without cutting again. This can be problematic as you may wish make any number of changes to enclosed items (such as make the sound of a kick drum's tail longer, etc.). You cannot do this using Glue.

The other option is to **Group** items. This works well if you simply want to  move items around or select multiple items by clicking one item; however, you cannot use the other benefits of Reaper items, such as quickly looping, take envelopes, etc. Grouping can become confusing because Groups are highlighted in green around the items, but *not* around the boundary of the group itself. Groups can be unwieldy to work with in many musical contexts, such as a four-bar repetition. Groups tend to create visual clutter.

**Glue-Reversible** aims to address the shortcomings of both Glue and Groups, as well as restore the convenient functionality already present in items (looping, timestretching, and much more), by placing selected items in a new container item.

### How to use

**To use Glue-Reversible**, simply select items and trigger one of the Glue-Reversible Glue or Smart Glue scripts (obey time selection enabled/disabled).

To edit your glued items, the **Edit** script opens the created container item, revealing the contained items once again. To reglue, just use one of the Glue scripts again. 

**Smart Glue/Edit** (with time selection enabled/disabled) will intelligently determine which action is required based on your item selections.

### Features
- Fills in the missing **nondestructive/reversible Glue function** in Reaper!
- - A.k.a.: Glue Groups, Item Containers, Container Items, Pooled Item Boxes, Pooled Audio Items
- Currently, Glue-Reversible container item copies are **pooled by default**. Editing and regluing one container item **updates all instances**. (Yes! We have scripted the missing native **pooled audio items** feature in Reaper along with everything else!)
- Supports **nesting Glue-Reversible container items** inside other container items! When you update the nested container item, the script checks the parent item and updates that as well. There is no limit in the code as to how many times you can nest â€“ tested with 20 levels of nesting.

### Tips
- **Using just the pooled audio item feature:** Feel free to glue a single audio item and make copies of that! Since every glued container item you copy is a pooled audio item, all you need to ensure all the copies stay updated is Edit any one of the pooled glue containers and reglue after.
- In Edit mode, the automatically created region can be used to increase the size of your glued container item. Otherwise, the size will be determined by the items selected as with native Reaper glue.

### Notes
- Requires **Reaper v6.43** or newer
- Requires **SWS Plugin Extension**!
- Don't **Clean current project directory** after gluing, or you'll lose your original items!
- Uses item notes to set background image for easy recognition of glued container and contained items. Careful: **The background image will overwrite any item notes you already have on your glued items.** Disable this feature in the script options if you want your item notes preserved.
- To create **MIDI container items**, the script uses "Apply track FX as new take" on each item to get a (silent) wav audio take. When you Edit, the wav take is removed and just the original MIDI take is restored to active. Currently only MIDI on virtual instrument tracks is supported.
- When using copies of Glue-Reversible container items, you can't make a copy of itself inside itself, as that would cause an **infinite recursion**.
- When gluing with time selection, ensure your time selection includes all items being glued because of [this Reaper bug](https://forums.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=258769).
- Uses **item selection set slot 10** at times to save and recall selected items.
 
### History

matthewjumpsoffbuildings created the powerful, excellent "Glue Groups" scripts: https://bitbucket.org/matthewjumpsoffbuildings/reaper-scripts/src/master/

MonkeyBars continues the effort with some different nomenclature (in the interest of onboarding new users and making it easy to find in the Actions Window), bugfixes, and additional features.


### Planned improvements
See [enhancement Issues](https://github.com/MonkeyBars3k/ReaScripts/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement).
